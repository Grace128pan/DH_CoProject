            <h1><i>Public Opinion and Political Spectrums Analysis in China</i></h1>
            <h2>I. Project Introduction</h2>
            <p>This project aims to employ mathematical and statistical methodologies, alongside an array of natural language processing (NLP) tools, to extract and analyze public opinion on various topics across multiple social media platforms, with a current focus on <strong><a href="https://www.zhihu.com/">Zhihu</a></strong>, the Chinese equivalent of Quora.</p>
            <p>Subsequently, the results will be compared with government narratives by analyzing internal government references, public documents, and news from state-owned media and press. </p>
            <p>The primary objectives are to delineate the spectrum of public opinion, identify discrepancies between public sentiment and the government’s perspective, and, crucially, to understand the underlying factors contributing to these discrepancies.</p>
