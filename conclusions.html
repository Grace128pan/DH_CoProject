                </ul>

            <br>
            <p><strong>Summary</strong>: Our findings illustrate a significant gap between public sentiment and government narratives across several important social issues. While the public expresses concern primarily centered around personal impact, trust, and ethical considerations, government perspectives tend to prioritize broader economic, demographic, and social stability goals. This disconnect underscores the need for policies that bridge the gap between individual needs and macroeconomic objectives to foster a more supportive and cohesive society. </p>
